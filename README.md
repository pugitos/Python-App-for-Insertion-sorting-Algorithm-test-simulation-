# Why Insertion sorting
Choosing Insertion sorting adds a lot of flexibility for the user if they want to add more to the application 
without the whole process being redone. However, the initial process would be slower compared to the other sorting 
algorithms. 

# Using Computational Thinking

Decomposition: Knowing the goal is to create an application, there are multiple problem we have to get done so that our algorithm will work.
               creating a base case to stop the algorithm when all objects are sorted, create a dictionary list to give each letter 
               In the English alphabet, a value with the lexicographic order, check for user errors, check for unusual errors example empty list. 
               Create an input system for the user, check for wrong inputs from the user, and insert user's input into the sorting algorithm
               
Pattern Recognition: This system will keep comparing the value given to each first letter of an object, and if the object has the 
                     same letter, then we compare the next letter. until one is greater than the other. With insertion sort, this will 
                     check all numbers on the left side of the list.
                     
Abstraction: The user would only need to know that this will sort alphabetically the names given in the list. They are able to add as much as they like to the list.
                                                                                                                                         
Algorithm Design: UserInput are (input Making the list, Click button to start the sorting ), Output(sorted list for the user)
