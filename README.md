# Python-App-for-Insertion-sorting-Algorithm-test-simulation-
This is application to sort the user stuff by alphabet order and able to insert more items wanted in

# Why Insertion sorting
Choosing Insertion sorting adds alot of flexabilty for the user if they wanted to add more into the application 
without the whole process being redone. However the inital process would be slower compared than the other sorting 
algorithms

# Using Computational Thinking

Decomposition: Knowing the goal is to create a application there is multple problem we have to get done so then our algorithm will work.
               creating base case to stop the algorithm when all objects are sorted, create a dictonary list to give each letter 
               in the english alphabet a value with the lex, check for user errors, check for unsual errors example empty list, 
               create a input system for the user, check for worng inputs from user, insert users input into sorting algorithm
               
Pattern Recognition: This system will keep comparing the value given to each first letter of an object and if the object have the 
                     same letter then we compare the next letter. until one is greater than the other. With insertion sort this will 
                     check all number on the left side of the list.

Abstraction: The user would only need to know that this will sort alphabet order of the names given in the list. There are able to add as much as they like into the list.
                                                                                                                                         
Algorithm Design: UserInput are (input list and asking if they want to keep adding more into the list), Output( sorted list for the user)
